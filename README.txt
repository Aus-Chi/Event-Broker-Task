Service Name and ID: 
 -> Name: austin's demo event broker
 -> ID: ymxmw2v4jpe

Explanation:
 -> I extensively watched Solace's YouTube videos on how to navigate through Solace cloud to create the broker service and others like a queue and understanding Replays are possible as well.
 -> I implemented two publishers using java and JavaScript and I didn't really have any challenge, just that I had to rely on Solace's documentation on how to connect to my broker service to publish messages.

NB:

*for the javascript code, since there is no node module due to the size. npm install solclientjs must be run first.
